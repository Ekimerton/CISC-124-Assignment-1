1. Yes, the Toronto Maple Leafs were higher than 8th place, so they made the playoffs.

2. Since the leafs got first place in my run, it is safe to say that the minimum skill rating is below the current
skill rating. The problem with pinpointing a specific number is because of the amount of randomization that goes
towards score. A team full of low skill players can beat a team full of higher skill players, since there are so
many random factors. How well the team plays (eg. the +25, -25 for forwards... etc), how many goals they score per
50 skill points, which players are chosen (goalies for regulation/ goalies and defenders for overtime).
