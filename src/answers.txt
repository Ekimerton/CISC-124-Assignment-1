1. Yes, the Toronto Maple Leafs were higher than 8th place (2nd place), so they made the playoffs.

2. The leafs got second place in my run, behind Tampa Bay. Though the random additions of points can change 1st place on a case by case basis, Tampa Bay consistenly seems to win the most. Since the random parts can't be affected, we'll compare the skills, and see if Toronto needs an edge.

Sum of Tampa Bay skills: forwards = 94, defenders = 58, goalies = 33, total = 185
Sum of Toronto skills: forwards = 96, defenders = 50, goalies = 28, total = 174

The forwards of the Leafs have an edge on Tampa Bay, but the defense would benefit from gaining 8 more skill overall, and goalies 5 more skill.
